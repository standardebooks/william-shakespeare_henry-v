									<span>Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies</span>

									<span>The well-appointed king at Hampton pier</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Play with your fancies, and in them behold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow’d sea,</span>

									<span>You stand upon the rivage and behold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A city on the inconstant billows dancing;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For so appears this fleet majestical,</span>

									<span>Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>With one appearing hair, that will not follow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These cull’d and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner</span>

									<span>With linstock now the devilish cannon touches, <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Alarum, and chambers go off.</i></span>

They will steal anything, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.
