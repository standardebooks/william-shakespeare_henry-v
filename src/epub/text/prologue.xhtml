								<span>O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The brightest heaven of invention,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leash’d in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The flat unraised spirits that hath dared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So great an object: can this cockpit hold</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Within this wooden O the very casques</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That did affright the air at Agincourt?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O pardon! since a crooked figure may</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Attest in little place a million;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On your imaginary forces work.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Suppose within the girdle of these walls</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are now confined two mighty monarchies,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose high upreared and abutting fronts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into a thousand parts divide one man,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And make imaginary puissance;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Printing their proud hoofs i’ the receiving earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Carry them here and there; jumping o’er times,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Turning the accomplishment of many years</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into an hourglass: for the which supply,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Admit me Chorus to this history;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></span>
