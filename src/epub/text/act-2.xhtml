								<p>
									<span>Now all the youth of England are on fire,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now thrive the armourers, and honour’s thought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Reigns solely in the breast of every man.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Following the mirror of all Christian kings,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With winged heels, as English Mercuries.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For now sits Expectation in the air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And hides a sword from hilts unto the point</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With crowns imperial, crowns, and coronets,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Promis’d to Harry and his followers.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The French, advis’d by good intelligence</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of this most dreadful preparation,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shake in their fear, and with pale policy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Seek to divert the English purposes.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O England! model to thy inward greatness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like little body with a mighty heart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were all thy children kind and natural!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sir Thomas Grey, knight of Northumberland,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have, for the gilt of France⁠—O guilt indeed!⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Confirm’d conspiracy with fearful France;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And by their hands this grace of kings must die,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If hell and treason hold their promises,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Linger your patience on, and we’ll digest</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The abuse of distance, force a play.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The King is set from London; and the scene</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There is the playhouse now, there must you sit;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And thence to France shall we convey you safe,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bring you back, charming the narrow seas</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, till the King come forth, and not till then,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.</span>
