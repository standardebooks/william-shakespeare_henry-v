									<span>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To make against your highness’ claim to France</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“<i xml:lang="la">In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</i>:”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“No woman shall succeed in Salique land:”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which Salique land the French unjustly glose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The founder of this law and female bar.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That the land Salique is in Germany,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There left behind and settled certain French;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who, holding in disdain the German women</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For some dishonest manners of their life,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Establish’d then this law; to wit, no female</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which Salique, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is at this day in Germany call’d Meissen.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then doth it well appear the Salique law</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was not devised for the realm of France;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until four hundred one and twenty years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>After defunction of King Pharamond,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who died within the year of our redemption</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did, as heir general, being descended</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To find his title with some shows of truth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Convey’d himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was reunited to the crown of France.</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>So do the kings of France unto this day;</span>

									<span>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</span>
