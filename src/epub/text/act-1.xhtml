							<span>O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</span>

							<br/>
							<span>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</span>

							<span>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</span>

							<span>Into a thousand parts divide one man,</span>

							<span>Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</span>

								<span>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To make against your Highness’ claim to France</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</span>
								<br/>
								<span><i xml:lang="la">In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</i>,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“No woman shall succeed in Salic land;”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The founder of this law and female bar.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That the land Salic is in Germany,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where Charles the Great, having subdu’d the Saxons,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There left behind and settled certain French;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who, holding in disdain the German women</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For some dishonest manners of their life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Establish’d then this law, to wit, no female</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Should be inheritrix in Salic land;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which Salic, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is at this day in Germany call’d Meissen.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then doth it well appear the Salic law</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was not devised for the realm of France;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor did the French possess the Salic land</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Until four hundred one and twenty years</span>
								<br/>
								<span>After defunction of King Pharamond,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Idly suppos’d the founder of this law,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who died within the year of our redemption</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Subdu’d the Saxons, and did seat the French</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Did, as heir general, being descended</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To find his title with some shows of truth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Convey’d himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Charles the Great. Also, King Lewis the Tenth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was reunited to the crown of France.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To hold in right and title of the female.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So do the kings of France unto this day,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And rather choose to hide them in a net</span>
								<br/>
