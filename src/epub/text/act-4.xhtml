								<span>Now entertain conjecture of a time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When creeping murmur and the poring dark</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From camp to camp through the foul womb of night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That the fix’d sentinels almost receive</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The secret whispers of each other’s watch;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each battle sees the other’s umber’d face;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The armourers, accomplishing the knights,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Give dreadful note of preparation.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the third hour of drowsy morning name.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The confident and over-lusty French</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Do the low-rated English play at dice;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And chide the cripple tardy-gaited Night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So tediously away. The poor condemned English,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sit patiently and inly ruminate</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The morning’s danger; and their gesture sad,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Presented them unto the gazing moon</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The royal captain of this ruin’d band</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let him cry, “Praise and glory on his head!”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For forth he goes and visits all his host,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Upon his royal face there is no note</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How dread an army hath enrounded him;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unto the weary and all-watched night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But freshly looks, and overbears attaint</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A largess universal like the sun</span>

								<span>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Behold, as may unworthiness define,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A little touch of Harry in the night.</span>

His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are; yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.</td>

I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</td>

						<td>So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcil’d iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of Peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish’d for before-breach of the King’s laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the King’s; but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained; and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</td>
